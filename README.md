BearTracks is a website developed by four UC Berkeley students who believe every student 
should have access to all the academic opportunities their school has to offer. This 
website allows students to explore course pathways, graduation requirements, and career 
options. It is particularly useful for students who are undeclared, as they are able to 
learn more about each major and its requirements. We hope that by using BearTracks, 
students are better equipped with the necessary tools to find subjects they're passionate 
about and make the most of their education.

Schedule planning simplified.
